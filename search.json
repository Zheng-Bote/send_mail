"content": " SendMail SendMail is a robust C++23 console application designed to automate email dispatching based on file system events. Built with Qt6 and the SimpleMail library, it monitors a specific directory and automatically emails the contents of distinctively named text files. Architecture The application follows a strict Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainabilty: Model ( ConfigModel ) : Responsible for loading and validating application configuration from environment variables ( .env ). It provides a clean interface for accessing SMTP credentials and runtime settings. View : As a background console application, the &quot;View&quot; is represented by the standard output/logging (QDebug/QInfo) which provides real-time status updates and error reporting to the administrator. Controller ( MailController ) : The core logic engine. It manages the QFileSystemWatcher to monitor the target directory. Upon detecting valid files, it orchestrates the workflow by reading the file and delegating the transmission task to the Service layer. Service ( SmtpService ) : A dedicated service wrapper around SimpleMail . It handles the low-level SMTP protocol details, including connection establishment, STARTTLS upgrades, finding the correct authentication method ( AUTH LOGIN ), and MIME message construction. Workflow Initialization : The app loads settings from SendMail.env . Monitoring : It starts watching the configured WATCH_DIR for files matching *.SendMail . Detection : When a file like user@example.com.SendMail is created: The Controller detects the event. It waits for a stabilization period (2 seconds) to ensure the write is complete. Processing : The recipient email is extracted from the filename ( user@example.com ). The file content is read and used as the email body. Transmission : SmtpService connects to the SMTP server (using STARTTLS/AuthLogin) and sends the email. Cleanup : On successful transmission, the source file is deleted from the disk. Prerequisites Linux (Tested on current distributions) C++23 Compiler (GCC 12+ or Clang 16+) CMake 3.24 or higher Qt6 (Core, Network) OpenSSL Build Instructions # Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/Zheng-Bote/send-mail.git cd send-mail # Create build directory mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build # Configure and Build cmake .. make -j$(nproc) Configuration Create a SendMail.env file in the same directory as the executable (or copy docs/SendMail.env ): SMTP_SERVER=&quot;smtp.example.com&quot; SMTP_PORT=&quot;587&quot; SMTP_USERNAME=&quot;user@example.com&quot; SMTP_PASSWORD=&quot;secret_password&quot; SMTP_FROM=&quot;sender@example.com&quot; # &quot;true&quot; to enforce STARTTLS SMTP_STARTTLS=&quot;true&quot; # Directory to monitor WATCH_DIR=&quot;../data&quot; Usage Run the application: ./SendMail To trigger an email, create a file in the watched directory: echo &quot;Hello World&quot; &gt; data/recipient@domain.com.SendMail The application will pick up this file, send an email to recipient@domain.com with the body &quot;Hello World&quot;, and then delete the file. Troubleshooting Error 535 5.7.8 : This usually indicates an authentication failure. Ensure your SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_PASSWORD are correct. The application enforces AUTH LOGIN which is required by many providers like Netcup. STARTTLS : The application logs the connection type on startup. Check the console output to verify if secure connection is enabled. License This project is licensed under the MIT License. ",
